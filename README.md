# DIY Forth Interpreter
in the early 80's I bought a Noth Star Computers Horizon S100 computer. The OS was CP/M. I used it to put together a two axis data collection, correction,
and validation system for our CalComp digitizers. For the application code I started with the article "Write Your Own FORTH Interpreter", by Richard Fritzson,
in Kilobaud Microcomputing, February 1981 page 76 - 92. I typed in and compiled th Forth interpreter as the foundation of the control software that I wrote.
The article can be found in the public domain in the Internet Archive at:

I am "copying" all of the listings, minus the hexidecimal bytes, for re-use here. My plan is to later branch this to an #RC2014 robot project.
